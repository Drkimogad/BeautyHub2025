Firebase Migration Considerations
Authentication:
Current: Hardcoded credentials in admin.js

Firebase: OAuth/Email-Password with proper security rules

Migration: Replace CONFIG.TEST_CREDENTIALS with Firebase Auth calls

Data Structure:
Collections: orders, customers, products, inventory

Relations: Orders reference customers, items reference products

Indexes: Create for surname+phone searches, status filters

Image Storage Strategy:
Option A - Firebase Storage:

Upload product images to Firebase Storage

Store download URLs in Firestore

Use CDN for fast delivery

Requires admin upload interface

Option B - Hybrid (Recommended for migration):

Keep existing images in /gallery/ folder

New products use Firebase Storage

Base URL configuration for environment switching

Graceful fallback to local images

Option C - External CDN:

Use dedicated image hosting (Cloudinary, Imgix)

Automatic optimization, resizing

Separate from Firebase costs

Real-time Features:
Firestore listeners for live order updates

Automatic dashboard refresh when orders change

Cross-tab synchronization

Offline support with local cache

Respect Architecture - Maintain modular JS structure

Migration Ready - Code structured for Firebase transition

Ready for Next Phase
The foundation is solid with:

✅ Complete customer journey

✅ Robust admin system

✅ Customer search functionality

Next logical step: Begin Priority 3 - Inventory Management with product CRUD operations and stock tracking.
Basic, Practical Products Management
Core Features Needed:
1. Product CRUD Operations:

Add Product: Form with name, price, stock, category, image URL

Edit Product: Update existing product details

Delete Product: Remove with confirmation

View Products: Grid/list with quick actions

2. Stock Management:

Current Stock display for each product

Auto-deduct when orders placed

Low Stock Alerts (visual indicator when stock < threshold)

Manual Stock Update (restock/adjustments)

3. Product Display:

Categories Filter: Perfumes, Lashes, Skincare, Wigs

Stock Status Badges: "In Stock", "Low Stock", "Out of Stock"

Quick Edit: Stock adjustment without full edit

Suggested Products Management Modal:
Based on your current admin dashboard design:

text
┌─────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ Products Management           [Add New] │
├─────────────────────────────────────────┤
│ [All] [Perfumes] [Lashes] [Skincare]    │
│ [Wigs] [Low Stock] [Out of Stock]       │
├─────────────────────────────────────────┤
│ ┌─────────────────────────────────┐     │
│ │ PRODUCT CARD:                  │     │
│ │ [Image]                        │     │
│ │ Product Name                   │     │
│ │ R299.99 • Stock: 15            │     │
│ │ [Edit] [Adjust Stock] [Delete] │     │
│ └─────────────────────────────────┘     │
│                                         │
│ ┌─────────────────────────────────┐     │
│ │ PRODUCT CARD:                  │     │
│ │ [Image]                        │     │
│ │ Product Name                   │     │
│ │ R499.99 • Stock: 3 (LOW!)      │     │
│ │ [Edit] [Adjust Stock] [Delete] │     │
│ └─────────────────────────────────┘     │
└─────────────────────────────────────────┘
Product Card Actions:
Edit: Opens full edit modal

Adjust Stock: Quick +/- buttons popup

Delete: With "Move to out of stock?" option

Practical Implementation Plan:
Phase 1 - Basic CRUD:

productsManager.js - Product schema & localStorage operations

Add "Products" tab to existing admin dashboard

Simple add/edit forms

Phase 2 - Stock Integration:

Connect to ordersManager.js to deduct stock

Low stock indicators

Quick stock adjustment

Phase 3 - Enhanced Display:

Categories filtering

Search within products

Bulk actions

Key Insights:
Reuse your existing admin modal pattern - same style, same UX

Start with localStorage - same pattern as orders/customers

Simple schema first - expand later

Integrate gradually - connect stock to existing order flow
